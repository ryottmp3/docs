Hi! I'm booking a tour for Pittsburgh Punk band The Karens. They will be coming through the <AREA> Area on April <#> 2024, and are looking for a show. They are seeking a $250 guarantee or at least a 50% split of door and (if possible) a place to crash for the night (punk houses/squats/etc...). Their music can be found at the following links:
